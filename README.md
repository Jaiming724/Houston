# Houston

Houston is a React based dashboard for monitoring Arduino data. I built it to monitor my university's wind turbine, but it can be used for any Arduino board.  

## ToDo (not necessarily in order)

* Cleaner UI
* ~~Graphs~~
* Save Data to File
* Max,min,etc for variables
* Migrate to Typescript
* Configuring Variables Live
* Installation Guide
