# Houston

Houston is a React based dashboard for monitoring Arduino data. I built it to monitor my university's wind turbine, but it can be used for any Arduino board.  

## Roadmap (not necessarily in order)

* Cleaner UI
* Graphs
* Migrate to Typescript
* Configuring variables live
* Installation guide
